        "[Perception Test: A Diagnostic Benchmark for Multimodal Video Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13786) is a multimodal benchmark designed to comprehensively evaluate the perception and reasoning skills of multimodal video models. The Perception Test dataset introduces real-world videos designed to show perceptually interesting situations and defines multiple computational tasks (object and point tracking, action and sound localisation, multiple-choice and grounded video question-answering). Here, we provide details and a baseline for the temporal action localisation task.\n",
